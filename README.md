# Indian Kids Screen Time Analysis 2025

This project analyzes the "Indian Kids Screentime 2025 Dataset" to understand screen time patterns, health impacts, and risk factors among Indian children. The analysis includes various aspects such as screen time patterns, correlation with health outcomes, urban vs. rural disparities, educational vs. recreational screen time classification, time series analysis, clustering for user segmentation, and predictive modeling for identifying at-risk children.

## Project Structure

- `Indian_Kids_Screen_Time.csv`: The original dataset containing information about children's screen time habits
- `processed_data.csv`: Processed dataset with additional features and cleaned data
- `sample_data.csv`: Small sample dataset for testing when the full dataset is not available

- `dashboard.py`: Interactive Dash web application for exploring the analysis results
- `data_analysis.py`: Python script for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization
- `streamlit_app.py`: Streamlit web application for interactive data exploration and visualization

- `optimize_images.py`: Utility script to optimize PNG images to reduce project size
- `cleanup.py`: Utility script to remove unnecessary files and reduce project size

## Project Optimization

To reduce the project size and optimize for version control, this repository includes utility scripts:

### Image Optimization

The `optimize_images.py` script converts large PNG files to optimized JPG format:

```bash
python optimize_images.py
```

This will create optimized versions of all PNG files in an `optimized_images` directory.

### Project Cleanup

The `cleanup.py` script helps identify and remove unnecessary files and directories:

```bash
python cleanup.py
```

This interactive script will show you large files/directories that can be safely removed to reduce project size.

### Version Control Optimization

The `.gitignore` file is configured to exclude:
- Virtual environments (venv, .venv, env, etc.)
- Python cache files (__pycache__)
- Jupyter Notebook checkpoints (.ipynb_checkpoints)
- Build and distribution directories
- Large data files (except processed_data.csv which is needed for deployment)
- Log files and temporary files
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required for the project

8. **Interactive Dashboard**: Provides a user-friendly interface to explore all analysis results

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3.11 or later installed
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1  # On Windows PowerShell
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Data Analysis**:
   Run the data analysis script to process the data and generate visualizations:
   ```
   python data_analysis.py
   ```

2. **Dash Dashboard**:
   Launch the Dash dashboard to explore the analysis results interactively:
   ```
   python dashboard.py
   ```
   Then open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8050/

3. **Streamlit App**:
   Launch the Streamlit app for an alternative interactive interface:
   ```
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```
   Then open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8501/

## Deployment to Hugging Face Spaces

This project is ready to be deployed to Hugging Face Spaces. Follow these steps to deploy:

1. **Create a Hugging Face Account**:
   If you don't have one already, sign up at [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/join).

2. **Create a New Space**:
   - Go to [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces)
   - Click on "Create a new Space"
   - Choose a name for your space
   - Select "Streamlit" as the SDK
   - Choose the appropriate hardware tier (Free tier is sufficient for this app)

3. **Upload Files to the Space**:
   You can either use the Hugging Face web interface to upload files or use Git:

   **Using Git**:
   ```
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git remote add space https://huggingface.co/spaces/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_SPACE_NAME
   git push --force space main
   ```

   **Required Files for Deployment**:
   - `streamlit_app.py`: The main Streamlit application
   - `requirements.txt`: Dependencies for the application
   - `Indian_Kids_Screen_Time.csv`: The dataset (or `processed_data.csv` if available)
   - Any image files referenced in the app

4. **Configure the Space**:
   - In your Space settings, ensure that the "App file path" is set to `streamlit_app.py`
   - You can also customize the Space with a description, tags, and a thumbnail

5. **Access Your Deployed App**:
   Once deployed, your app will be available at `https://huggingface.co/spaces/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_SPACE_NAME`

```

This will create a `processed_data.csv` file and several visualization images.

   ```
   python dashboard.py
   ```
   Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8050/ to view the dashboard.

## Dashboard Tabs

- **Overview**: General statistics and distribution of key variables
- **Screen Time Patterns**: Analysis of screen time by age, gender, device, and location
- **Health Impacts**: Correlation between screen time and various health outcomes
- **Educational vs. Recreational**: Analysis of educational and recreational screen time patterns
- **User Segments**: Clustering results showing different user segments
- **Risk Prediction**: Predictive model results for identifying at-risk children

## Requirements

The project requires the following Python libraries:
- pandas==2.0.3
- numpy==1.24.3
- scikit-learn==1.3.0
- plotly==5.15.0
- dash==2.11.1
- dash-bootstrap-components==1.4.1
- statsmodels==0.14.0
- matplotlib==3.7.2
- seaborn==0.12.2

## Notes

- The dashboard requires the `processed_data.csv` file generated by running `data_analysis.py` first
- If the processed data file is not found, the dashboard will attempt to use the original dataset with minimal processing

## Key Insights & Outcomes

This analysis provides several valuable insights about children's screen time habits:

1. **Screen Time Patterns**: Identifies age and gender-based patterns in screen time consumption, showing which demographic groups are most at risk for excessive screen time.

2. **Health Impact Assessment**: Quantifies the correlation between screen time duration and various health outcomes, including physical, mental, and social impacts.

3. **Digital Divide Analysis**: Reveals significant disparities between urban and rural children's screen time habits and device access.

4. **Educational Value Assessment**: Measures the ratio of educational to recreational screen time across different age groups and demographics.

5. **User Segmentation**: Identifies three distinct user segments ("Heavy Usage", "Moderate Usage", and "Low Usage") with unique characteristics and risk profiles.

6. **Predictive Risk Model**: Provides a machine learning model that can identify children at high risk of negative health impacts from screen time with high accuracy.

7. **Interactive Visualization**: Delivers an intuitive dashboard that allows stakeholders to explore data patterns and make informed decisions about screen time interventions.

These insights can help parents, educators, healthcare professionals, and policymakers develop targeted interventions to promote healthier screen time habits among Indian children."# Indian-Kids-Screen-Time-Analysis-2025"
