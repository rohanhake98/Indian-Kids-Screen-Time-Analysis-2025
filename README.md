# Indian Kids Screen Time Analysis 2025

This project analyzes the "Indian Kids Screentime 2025 Dataset" to understand screen time patterns, health impacts, and risk factors among Indian children. The analysis includes various aspects such as screen time patterns, correlation with health outcomes, urban vs. rural disparities, educational vs. recreational screen time classification, time series analysis, clustering for user segmentation, and predictive modeling for identifying at-risk children.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for data analysis and visualization
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and numerical computations
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms for clustering and predictive modeling
- **Plotly & Dash**: Interactive data visualization and dashboard creation
- **Dash Bootstrap Components**: Responsive UI components for the dashboard
- **Statsmodels**: Statistical modeling and time series analysis
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Static data visualization and statistical graphics

## Project Structure

- `Indian_Kids_Screen_Time.csv`: The original dataset containing information about children's screen time habits
- `data_analysis.py`: Python script for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization
- `dashboard.py`: Interactive Dash web application for exploring the analysis results
- `processed_data.csv`: Cleaned and processed dataset with additional features (generated by data_analysis.py)
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required for the project

## Features

1. **Screen Time Pattern Analysis**: Examines screen time distribution by age, gender, and device preference
2. **Health Impact Correlation**: Studies the relationship between screen time and various health outcomes
3. **Urban vs. Rural Disparity Analysis**: Compares screen time patterns between urban and rural children
4. **Educational vs. Recreational Classification**: Analyzes the ratio of educational to recreational screen time
5. **Time Series Analysis**: Examines screen time trends over time (simulated in this project)
6. **User Segmentation**: Uses clustering to identify distinct user segments based on screen time patterns
7. **Risk Prediction**: Builds a predictive model to identify children at risk of excessive screen time
8. **Interactive Dashboard**: Provides a user-friendly interface to explore all analysis results

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3.11 or later installed
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1  # On Windows PowerShell
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Data Analysis**:
   Run the data analysis script to process the data and generate visualizations:
   ```
   python data_analysis.py
   ```
   This will create a `processed_data.csv` file and several visualization images.

2. **Interactive Dashboard**:
   Launch the Dash web application to explore the analysis results interactively:
   ```
   python dashboard.py
   ```
   Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8050/ to view the dashboard.

## Dashboard Tabs

- **Overview**: General statistics and distribution of key variables
- **Screen Time Patterns**: Analysis of screen time by age, gender, device, and location
- **Health Impacts**: Correlation between screen time and various health outcomes
- **Educational vs. Recreational**: Analysis of educational and recreational screen time patterns
- **User Segments**: Clustering results showing different user segments
- **Risk Prediction**: Predictive model results for identifying at-risk children

## Requirements

The project requires the following Python libraries:
- pandas==2.0.3
- numpy==1.24.3
- scikit-learn==1.3.0
- plotly==5.15.0
- dash==2.11.1
- dash-bootstrap-components==1.4.1
- statsmodels==0.14.0
- matplotlib==3.7.2
- seaborn==0.12.2

## Notes

- The dashboard requires the `processed_data.csv` file generated by running `data_analysis.py` first
- If the processed data file is not found, the dashboard will attempt to use the original dataset with minimal processing

## Key Insights & Outcomes

This analysis provides several valuable insights about children's screen time habits:

1. **Screen Time Patterns**: Identifies age and gender-based patterns in screen time consumption, showing which demographic groups are most at risk for excessive screen time.

2. **Health Impact Assessment**: Quantifies the correlation between screen time duration and various health outcomes, including physical, mental, and social impacts.

3. **Digital Divide Analysis**: Reveals significant disparities between urban and rural children's screen time habits and device access.

4. **Educational Value Assessment**: Measures the ratio of educational to recreational screen time across different age groups and demographics.

5. **User Segmentation**: Identifies three distinct user segments ("Heavy Usage", "Moderate Usage", and "Low Usage") with unique characteristics and risk profiles.

6. **Predictive Risk Model**: Provides a machine learning model that can identify children at high risk of negative health impacts from screen time with high accuracy.

7. **Interactive Visualization**: Delivers an intuitive dashboard that allows stakeholders to explore data patterns and make informed decisions about screen time interventions.

These insights can help parents, educators, healthcare professionals, and policymakers develop targeted interventions to promote healthier screen time habits among Indian children.
